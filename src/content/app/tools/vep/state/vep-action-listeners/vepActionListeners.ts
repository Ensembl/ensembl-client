/**
 * 1. Change submission id from the temporary client-side one to the permanentt one assigned by the server
 *   - In Redux
 *   - In indexedDB
 * 2. Change submission status:
 *   - SUBMITTED if submitted
 *   - UNSUCCESSFUL_SUBMISSION if failed to submit
 * 3. Start polling for submission status
 *   - SUBMITTED â€” continue polling
 *   - RUNNING - update status (in redux and in indexedDB); but continue polling
 *   - SUCCEEDED, FAILED, CANCELLED - update status (in redux and in indexedDB), and stop polling
 * 4. Note that user can refresh (or close/open) the browser while there are still some submissions pending.
 *    Therefore, listen to the restore VEP submissions event, filter unfinished submissions, and poll for their status.
 * 5. Note that user can delete a submission while polling is still in progress.
 *    Thus, listen to delete submission actions, and remove deleted submissions from polling.
