# FASTA TEST DATA FILES

## Test file descriptioins
- 001.txt — 1 protein sequence, FASTA-formatted (from Biopython examples)
- 002.txt — 3 DNA sequences, FASTA-formatted (from Biopython examples)
- 003.txt - same as 002.txt, but with empty lines separating sequences.
- 004.txt — example FASTA input generated by the Uniprot site. Contains spaces as convenient separators of nucleotide groups.
- 005.txt — bare sequence example from NCBI help docs.
- 006.txt — same as 005.txt; but copied directly from NCBI docs, where each line begins with two tab characters.
- 007.txt — bare sequence, identical to the one in 005.txt, but with numbered lines and spaces inside lines. Each line begins with two tab characters. Letters are lower-cased. Example copied from NCBI docs.
