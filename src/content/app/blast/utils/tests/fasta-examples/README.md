# FASTA TEST DATA FILES

## Example data from Biopython tests
- f001.fasta — 1 protein sequence
- f002.fasta — 3 DNA sequences

## Other examples
- f003.fasta — same as f002.fasta, but includes empty lines. Fasta files aren't supposed to have blank lines; but it's trivial to ignore them and not penalize the user.
- f004.fasta — example input generated by the Uniprot site. Contains spaces for user's convenience, although they aren't part of the format.
