 * - Close the communication panel and mark this notification

        Beta is a fresher, faster way to see genome annotation across the
        taxonomic tree and get the data you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the new home for both the most popular genome assemblies from
        each of the Ensembl divisions, as well as new genomes which would
        previously have been made available on Ensembl Rapid Release.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's early days for this new service, and we're working to continually
        improve and expand functionality - so any feedback would be much
        appreciatedâ€¦
