/**
 * This is a function for handling asynchronous tasks that are accompanied
 * by a change in the UI (e.g. a spinner) indicating that they are running.
 *
 * It is impossible to predict how long such a task may take â€” it may finish
 * almost immediately, or may take a long time. The purpose of the runAsyncVisualTask
 * function is to avoid unwelcome flickering on the screen caused by the loading indicator
 * quickly appearing and disappearing when the task is too quick to finish.
 *
 * Therefore, runAsyncVisualTask does the following:
 * - if the task finishes very quickly (faster than the interval set by the ignoreTime option),
 *   then do not bother displaying the loading indicator
 * - if the task takes longer than the ignoreTime period to complete, register
 *   the loading state, and maintain it for at least the interval defined by the minimumRunningTime
 *   option
 * - if the task finishes after the ignoreTime interval, but before the minimumRunningTime interval,
 *   keep the loading state until the minimumRunningTime interval expires
 *
 * The implementation was inspired by https://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-spinner-flickering?file=index.ts
