/**
 * This is a function for handling asynchronous tasks that are accompanied
 * by a change in the UI indicating that they are running (e.g. a spinner).
 *
 * It is impossible to predict how long a task may take â€” it may finish almost immediately,
 * or may run for a long time. The purpose of the runAsyncVisualTask utility function
 * is to prevent unwelcome flickering on the screen caused by the loading indicator
 * briefly appearing and disappearing when the task finishes too quickly
 * after the indicator is displayed.
 *
 * The runAsyncVisualTask function wraps an asynchronous task and does the following:
 * - if the task finishes very quickly (faster than the interval set by the ignoreTime option),
 *   then no signal for showing the loading indicator will be sent
 * - if the task takes longer than the ignoreTime period to complete, then the function
 *   sends a signal to show the loading indicator, and waits for at least the length of time
 *   defined by the minimumRunningTime option before sending a different signal
 * - thus, if the task completes after the ignoreTime interval, but before the minimumRunningTime expires,
 *   then its completion will be reported only after the minimumRunningTime interval runs out
 *
 * The implementation was inspired by https://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-spinner-flickering?file=index.ts
